# MyReads Project

This was my first React project from Udacity for my Masterschool COURSE.

This project was based on allowing a person to select books from an API, into different shelves(Currently Reading, Want To Read and Read).

For example choosing a book and placing it in "Want To Read", then moving it to another shelf "Currently Reading", then once you have read it, move to the final shelf "Read"
